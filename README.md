# Fullstack_Project Oinker
Webiste made using React and Node.js.
Details of the project are still TBD, but the basic idea is a Twitter like clone.
I'm designing this as i go, which is not really good idea, but i just want to get this started.

## TODO
Pretty much everything.

Create database using sequelize and PSQL
Need to start planning more what i need to do, so i don't have to refactor so much of this.
Also make sure database is stable.
